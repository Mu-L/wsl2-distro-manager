/// Changing a VM's hardware after it was created (bostrot/ai-tasks#103).
///
/// `create` is the only place that ever chose a VM's CPU count, memory and
/// disk size, and nothing could change them afterwards: a guest created with
/// the 32 GB default and then filled up had to be recreated from scratch. The
/// three knobs are not equally reversible, so they are not treated alike:
///
/// * **CPUs and memory** are config only. Nothing on disk depends on the old
///   values, so either direction is fine and the VM picks the new ones up the
///   next time `VMFactory` builds its configuration — that is, on its next
///   start.
/// * **The disk only grows.** The image is a raw disk with a partition table
///   and a filesystem inside it; truncating it shorter cuts through whatever
///   the guest put at the end, and nothing here can know what that is. A
///   shrink is refused rather than attempted.
///
/// Growing the *image* is not the same as growing the guest's filesystem: the
/// guest sees a bigger block device and a partition table that still describes
/// the old extent. A Linux guest seeded by this app fixes that itself —
/// cloud-init's `growpart` module runs on every boot (`PER_ALWAYS`) and
/// resizes the root partition and filesystem to fill the device. A macOS
/// guest, or a Linux guest installed from an ISO without cloud-init, needs the
/// user to do it once from inside; the JSON says which case the VM is in so
/// the app can say so too.
